# Enigma
Python Implementation of Enigma


🔍 About

This is a simple Python implementation of the Enigma machine, a historical cipher device used during World War II. The program simulates the encryption process by passing messages through multiple rotors.

🚀 How to Run

Make sure you have Python installed (version 3.6 or higher).

Download or clone this repository.

Run the script in a terminal:

python enigma.py

🛠 How It Works

The program generates random rotor settings at runtime.

The user enters a message, and it is encrypted using multiple rotors.

The encrypted message can be decrypted only if the rotor settings are known.

✉️ Example Usage

Enter the message you want to encrypt: ATTACK AT DAWN
Encrypted message: YBBYHP YB ZVBL.

🔮 Future Improvements (possibly)

Implement a decryption function.

Allow users to save and load rotor settings.

Add graphical interface.
